### Day 27: January 21st, 2021 (Thu)

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed CSS Grid via fun website (link below), also checked out more of CSS on another website #mindIsBlown, been learning JavaScript on Grasshopper website and got my certificate for Fundamentals I - yaaay, so exciting =D And the website is so encouraging and nice *.* 

**Time put in**: 5hrs

**Thoughts**:  I like easing into this JavaScript learning in a fun way, just to see how the code looks by playing games or following a responsive website instructions. At the moment it is not so important to understand everything, but simply to enjoy the process and let go, knowing I will understand everything after deep learning. #makingnConnectionsInBrain
